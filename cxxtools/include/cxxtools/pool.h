/**
 A pool is a container for reusable objects.

 It maintains a list of objects, which are not in use. If a program
 needs a object, he can request one with the get-method. The pool
 returns a object, which is convertable to the needed object. As long
 as the program holds this special object, the object is in use.

 Objects are created when needed and only deleted on request.
 A upper limit of objects can be passed to the constructor. This makes
 only sense in a multithreaded environment, because the get-method
 blocks, when the limit is reached and waits for someone to release a
 object.
