 Class for easy extraction of CGI-parameters.

 This class reads automatically GET- and POST-parameters from stdin
 and the environvariable QUERY_STRING, like CGI-programs do. This eases
 writing CGI-programs in C++.

 example:
 \code
   int main()
   {
     cgi q;  // this parses all input-parameters
     std::cout << q.header
               << "<html>\n"
               << "<body>\n"
               << "<form>\n"
               << "<input type=\"text\" name=\"v\"><br>\n"
               << "<input type=\"submit\"><br>\n"
               << "<hr>\n"
               << "</form>\n"
               << "you entered: <b>" << q["v"] << "</b>\n"
               << "</body>"
               << "</html>";
   }

/**
 This class outputs xml-tags and end-tags.

 When the class is put on the stack it prints the start-tag to the
 outputstream and when leaving scope prints end-tag. The end-tag
 is the start tag with '/' inserted at the second position.

 Tags are specified by text including or not including '<' and '>'.
 These brackets are recognized and printed also when not passed.
 Parameters in the tag can be passed as a separate parameter
 or delimited by space. After the first space everything is parameter
 and not repeated in the closing tag.

 Tags are closed in the destructor, if not already closed explicitely
 by calling the close()-method.
